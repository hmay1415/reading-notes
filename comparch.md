# Computer Architecture and Logic

What makes a computer a computer?

- has to take input, store info, process, and output results
- started as calculators
- algorithm - series of commands

Data and Binary

- use wires to store information
- one wire - yes/no, 1/0, true/false - called a bit
- more wires = more bits and more complex info
- decimal number system - each position is multiple of 10
- binary number system - each position is multiple of 2
- 32 wires - over 4 billion to store
- numbers are represented by numbers
- images - pictures, colors, represented by numbers
- sound - vibrations in wave form, represented by numbers

Circuits and Logic

- info represented by on / off electrical signals
- has to combine inputs using logic
- smaller circuits faster because less distance to go!

Memory, CPU, Input and Output

- CPU = central processing unit
- CPU determines how to draw letters you type, requests instructions from memory
- thousands of instructions to display 1 letter

Hardware and Software

- CPU is master chip that controls all other parts of the computer
- has circuits that do different things (math and logic, send and receive)
- commands stored in memory, fetched by CPU
- OS that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
- when running a bunch of programs at once, actually OS switching super fast, sharing that CPU
