Features to look for:
1. code completion: offers suggestions for text, closes brackets, availability of Emmet (shorthand language)
2. syntax highlighting: colorizes text you write. Attributes, elements, and copy are all different colors.
3. variety of themes: changes background/text color for ease on eyes
