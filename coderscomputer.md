##### Notes from [Choosing a Text Editor](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf)
- A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a website. It's one of the most important tools as an aspiring developer.
Features to look for:
1. code completion: offers suggestions for text, closes brackets, availability of Emmet (shorthand language)
2. syntax highlighting: colorizes text you write. Attributes, elements, and copy are all different colors.
3. variety of themes: changes background/text color for ease on eyes
4. choice of extensions: plugins for text editor
Built in text editors (bare bones):
- Mac: Text Edit
- Windows: Notepad
If using built in text editor:
1. create code in plain text editor
