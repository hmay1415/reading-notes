# Programming with JavaScript

## Class Notes

- variable - store piece of info
- datatypes: string ('hello'), number (45)
- string of '45' does not equal 45
- = assignment operator
- == equpals
- === strickly equals, compares value AND data type
- '45' == 45 is true, 'fortyfive' = 45 is not true
- '45' === 45 is not even true
- boolean type - true or false
- arrays and objects - will cover in 201
- when asking for user input, need to work out how to make sure different versions of the same answer are recogized as the same (yes, yessss, y) - toUppercase, toLowercase are examples of this. Just take 1st letter is an option
- || is or operator, && is and operator
- HTML runs top to bottom. Will run until hits JS and then pauses for command
