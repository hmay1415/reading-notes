- Comparison operators - return true or false
- == is equal to
- === is strict equal to - evaluates if both data type AND value are teh same
- != is not equal to
- !== strict not equal to
- > greater than
- < less than
- >= greater than or equal to
- <= less than or equal to
- called evaluating condition
- Logical operators - can compare results of more than 1 comparision operator
- %% logical and, tests more than one condition
- || logical or, tests at least one conditions
- ! logical not, takes single Boolean value and inverts it
- Loops - check a condition, if it returns true a code block will run. Repeats until condition returs false
- for - run loop a specific number of times
- while - runs for as long as condition is true
- do while - similar to while, but will always run statements in curly braces even if condition evaluates to false
- for loop uses counter as condition. made up of initalization (var 1 = 0), condition (i < 10), update (add one to counter using increment operator ++ or subtract one using decrement operator --)
- remember while examples as times table
