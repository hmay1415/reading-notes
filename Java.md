## Class Notes

CSS Recap

- `*{border: solid black 1px}` adds border to everything
- `boxsizing: border-box` includes border in box size
- float/relative position hard. flexbox and grid coming in 201/301 and will be easier!

Javascript Intro

- HTML is bones, CSS is skin, Java is muscle
- JavaScript - can store variables, iterate through arrays. More of programming language
- Java = compiled language. JavaScript = interpreted langauge
- Variable = temporary storage of something (think of different Amazon homepages for everyone)
