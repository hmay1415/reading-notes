# Git Practice Notes

1. The first heading can only have one `#`
2. There always has to be a space after a heading
3. There always need to be spaces on top and botto of a list
4. Only need to write `git push` not `git push origin master` to update the github page - verify with TA
5. `rm -rf` really does delete everything
