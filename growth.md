# Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset is important to adopt when learning a new skill. It's the belief that skills can be learned through dedication and hard work and we are all in control of our own abilities. The following are reminders to myself that I'll utilize to help keep me in a growth mindset:

1. When it feels hard and like you'll never grasp it, remember that even the most experienced coders felt the exact same way. You'll get through it.
2. When you see a challenge, view it as an exciting opportunity to learn, even if you stumble along the way.
3. View mistakes as great learning tools! Think about all the mistakes you've made in the past and how rarely you've made them a second time.
